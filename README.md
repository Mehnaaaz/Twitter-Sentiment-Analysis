# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sentiment in tweets using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. It preprocesses text data by tokenizing, removing stopwords, and applying lemmatization to clean and normalize the tweets. After preprocessing, the text is converted into numerical representations using methods like TF-IDF or Count Vectorization. Various classification models, including Na√Øve Bayes and Logistic Regression, are trained and evaluated to determine the most accurate sentiment classifier. The goal is to classify tweets into sentiment categories such as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Features
- Preprocessing of Twitter text data (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)
- Sentiment classification using machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, etc.)
- Data visualization for sentiment trends and insights
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed and set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended). Then, install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and test the model:

```sh
jupyter notebook "Twitter Sentiment Analysis.ipynb"
```

Alternatively, if a script is available:

```sh
python sentiment_analysis.py
```

## Dataset
The dataset used consists of tweets labeled with sentiment categories such as positive, negative, and neutral. You can use datasets from Kaggle, Twitter API, or other public sources.

## Model Training
1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Convert text data into numerical features.
3. Train multiple classification models and compare their performance.
4. Save the best-performing model for future inference.

## Evaluation
The trained model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

These metrics help determine how well the model classifies sentiment in tweets.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement deep learning models like LSTMs or Transformers for better sentiment analysis.
- Integrate real-time Twitter data streaming using the Twitter API.
- Develop a web-based or API-based sentiment analysis tool.
